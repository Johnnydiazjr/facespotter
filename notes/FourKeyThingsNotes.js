Four key things about this project things

#1 This is going to be hard. Watch ALL videos 
#2 The project works 
#3 Follow my method 
#4 GRPC 

#1 - Next couple of videos will be tough. Doing the things that many people find difficult. 

#2 - The project works. Sometimes as developers we think that we have done everything right and something is wrong with the project itself. There is something that we missed. It is checked weekly. It is our job to debug and figure out what is going wrong 

#3 - Follow the method of the course. It will show us how to use clarify API in a pretty convuluted way. There will be three methods of using the API. 

	a. Javascript NPM package 
	b. No NPM Package (fetch)
	c. GRPC NPM Package 

We will see an older version of an API in the beginning 

GRPC will be at the end when we will do a security analysis 

The key thing to remember is within Clarifai 
is there are multiple  ways  to  communicate with it

Many different clients 

We're going  to be using a deprecated system
